# Squad Up
Helps plan events with no worry

# Contributing
The entire point of making this open source was so other people could contribute 
if they wanted. If you think of an idea for a feature or find a problem don't 
hesitate to open a new Github issue.  

See the [Contributing](https://github.com/Noah-Huppert/squad-up/wiki/Contributing) page for more details.

# Development
Requirements:
- [Docker](https://docker.com)
- [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [Golang](https://golang.org)
- [NodeJs (For Bower)](https://nodejs.org/en/)
    - [Bower](https://bower.io)
- [Glide](http://glide.sh/)

I am trying to move everything to Docker so you only need Docker and Make 
to develop Squad Up ([GH issue on move](https://github.com/Noah-Huppert/squad-up/issues/8)). 
But low priority until I start deploying Squad Up (Because "it works on my system" right now).
