# Overview
Squad Up is a application which aims to take care of all the little annoying parts of 
planning an event with friends.

# Technical Goals
As creating native apps would be too much of a time commitment for such a small team 
we have opted to create the best website we can. Our goal is to make our website as 
good or better than most native apps. 

This will require care to optimization and user experience.
